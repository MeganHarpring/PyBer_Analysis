# **PyBer_Analysis**

### **Overview of the Analysis**
#### **Purpose:**
We can gain a lot of information and knowledge from these DataFrames, such as, we can see which city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) would be the best or most profitable as a driver, we can determine approximately how much you would make as a driver in the different city types, and much more. For this assignment we will analyze how each city type compares to the other two using a variety of variables. To do this we will create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. To do this we merged our DataFrames to create one that tells us the city, date, fare, ride, driver count, and city type. We will find how many rides there are in each city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural), how many drivers there are in each city type, the total fare for each city type, the average fare in each city type, the average fare per driver in each city type, and we will display this in a new DataFrame. Lasty, we will take this information in the DataFrame and create a line chart that shows us the total fare by city type. 

### **Results:**
##### Describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per driver for each city type, and total fare by city type.

In the table above we can see that urban cities have the most rides, drivers, and made the most in fares. The urban cities average fare per ride is the lowest and their average fare is over 2x less than that of the suburban and rural drivers. This makes sense as urban cities are much more populated so there are a lot of people in a smaller area wanting/meeding rides. Their rides would be much shorter thus why their average fare is much less than the suburban and rural cities but the total fare in urban cities is double that of suburban cities and 9x the rural cities. Below, you will see a line chart that depicts the total fare by city type throughout the year, thus we can easily see that urban cities make the most, then suburban, and lastly rural. We can also see what months are the busiest and the slowest. Between the months of January and May all city types had a speak in fare at the end of February. We can use these DataFrames to help ride-sharing companies predict, plan, and make decisions.

### **Summary:**
##### There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1) The first recommendation I would give to the CEO for addressing disparities is to have a larger dataset so that we can see yearly trends and also the more data we have the more accurate our predictions will be. There are many additional variable that would be useful. Having data on how much the company charges for rides, whats their base price, how do they come up with their base price, price per mile, average distance, and so on. This data will help us to determine where we can improve and how. 
2) There are too many drivers in the urban cities, there are more drivers than there are rides which means that not even all drivers get a ride. I would like to gain more data and look at how many rides the drivers get a day, a shift, an hour, the distance of their rides, average amount they make an hour, and so on. With more data we can then make decisions on how to improve the ride-sharing business for employees and customers. 
3) I would also consider some advertising/marketing campaigns seeing as the driver to ride ratio is very low, there are too many drivers for how many rides are being bought. They need to increase their customer base and gain more rides or decrease the number of drivers they have.
